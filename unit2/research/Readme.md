# Grammar of Graphics
Graph grammar is the way in which a simple graph can be improved so that it can be understood by people other than the branch to be displayed, making the information accessible to all.

This was developed in Leland Wilkinson's book The Grammar of Graphics in 2005, where he made the following points as his grammar:

## Data
These are the variables and information to be traced.
Aesthetics: it is the layer of scales, for example, the x and y axes, in which the data is assigned.

## Geometries
Shapes used to represent your data, for example, bars, lines, points, etc.

## Facets
When there are too many data points on a chart, you can split the variables to get a clearer view. With Facets, create rows and columns of subplots.

## Statics
Aggregated data (summaries) or trends using statistical models.
Coordinates - Describes the plot space you are using.

## Theme
The theme layer allows you to design with a particular visual identity using fonts, colors and other design elements.
